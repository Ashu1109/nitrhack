                    ontrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
                    text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
                    from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                    McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
                    Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
                    the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered
                    the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                    1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et
                    Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                    written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                    ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
                    of Lorem Ipsum, &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&quot;,
                    comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of
                    Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for
                    those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &quot;de
                    Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; by Cicero are also
                    reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by
                    English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
